    "sentiment_analysis": "Mixed with Strong Negative Undertones. While the customer expresses appreciation for Stampli (\"we love stampli\") and values the relationship, the overall sentiment is dominated by frustration and dissatisfaction. Critical pain points around payment timing, manual processes, and licensing costs are driving active exploration of alternatives. The tone is professional but firm, with explicit churn threats delivered transparently. The customer is giving Stampli a final opportunity to address issues before switching.",
    "summary": "VIVO Infusion is a high-risk churn account actively exploring alternative AP solutions due to critical unresolved issues. The company is experiencing growth (5 new facilities, de novos opening) and considering migration to NetSuite in 2026. Two major pain points are driving churn consideration: (1) Payment timing issues causing cash to leave 3-4 days early with no benefit, and (2) Carla's manual, time-consuming payment selection process that doesn't scale with growth. Additional friction includes hitting advanced user limits and frustration with licensing costs for approvers. Customer explicitly stated: \"if those items can't be fixed, unfortunately, we'll have to move off of stampli.\" No timeline provided for feature fixes, creating urgency gap.",
