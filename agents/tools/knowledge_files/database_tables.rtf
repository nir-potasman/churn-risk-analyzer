Additional guidance for categorization and call type detection:\
- To categorize a call as **prospect** or **current customer**:\
  * Use `call_accounts.acc_lifecyclestage` or `call_accounts.acc_hs_lead_status` (values containing \'93customer\'94 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  current customer).\
  * Also check `call_opportunities.opp_stagename` for \'93Closed Won\'94 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  current customer.\
  * Otherwise classify as prospect.\
- To categorize a call by **stage/type** (e.g., Demo, Discovery, QBR):\
  * Use `call_opportunities.opp_stagename` first, since it often contains values like \'93Demo\'94, \'93Discovery Meeting\'94, \'93QBR\'94.\
  * If empty, fallback to `call_topics.name`, `call_trackers.name`, or even keywords in `calls.title` / `calls.brief`.\
